## What is the pomodoro technique?
From Wikipedia: The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

## How does this timer help?
Personally, using a pomodoro timer helps me break down specific tasks and contextualized the amount of time and effort i'm putting towards them. By breaking up work intervals into 25 minutes blocks, i'm able to focus deeper on what i'm working on and avoid burnout. Also, it helps me to avoid feeling guilty when taking a break since they're scheduled and part of the part of the process.
